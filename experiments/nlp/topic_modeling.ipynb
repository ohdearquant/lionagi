    "Epidemiological models are best suitable to model an epidemic if the spread pattern is stationary. To deal with non-stationary patterns and multiple waves of an epidemic, we develop a hybrid model encompassing epidemic modeling, particle swarm optimization, and deep learning. The model mainly caters to three objectives for better prediction: 1. Periodic estimation of the model parameters. 2. Incorporating impact of all the aspects using data fitting and parameter optimization 3. Deep learning based prediction of the model parameters. In our model, we use a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) epidemic modeling, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for model parameter optimization, and stacked-LSTM for forecasting the model parameters. Initial or one time estimation of model parameters is not able to model multiple waves of an epidemic. So, we estimate the model parameters periodically (weekly). We use PSO to identify the optimum values of the model parameters. We next train the stacked-LSTM on the optimized parameters, and perform forecasting of the model parameters for upcoming four weeks. Further, we fed the LSTM forecasted parameters into the SIRD model to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases. We evaluate the model for highly affected three countries namely; the USA, India, and the UK. The proposed hybrid model is able to deal with multiple waves, and has outperformed existing methods on all the three datasets.\n",

    "I Introduction\n",
    "COVID-19 is one of the worst pandemics in the history. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. This virus causes common cold, respiratory problems, fever, dry cough, tiredness, sore throat, body pain, head ache, in some cases diarrhea, nausea, loss of sense of taste and smell, and many more health issues which can lead to death also [25, 27, 28]. COVID-19 had emerged as a major threat to human race in health, social, and economical aspects of life. Many pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical (lockdown, social distancing, face masking, quarantine, restriction policies) methods have been adopted to fight against the pandemic. Initially, complete lockdown had been imposed to contain the spread of the virus. But imposing complete lockdown for a long time is not a good solution because it may impact emotional and economical aspect of the public. Governments should analyze the situation at ground level and implement restriction policies in the affected area only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epidemiological compartmental models are commonly used for modeling the spread of an epidemic or a pandemic [11]. In these models, the population is assigned to specific labels, such as susceptible, exposed, infected, suspected, asymptomatic, hospitalized, recovered, dead etc. [4, 34]. These models use stochastic frameworks to forecast specific measures, such as the total number of infected, hospitalized, recovered, or dead people. The basic compartmental model is Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [16] which is further expanded by dividing the removed compartment into recovered (R) and dead (D) compartments which is known as the SIRD model [7]. It is assumed that an infected individual infects a susceptible one at a given rate \n",
    ". Once infected, the individual is removed from the susceptible compartment, and enters the infected compartment. Each infected person runs through the course of the disease, and eventually is removed from the infected compartment either by recovery or death. The removed people are considered permanently immune. Most of the compartmental models consider the disease spread inside a single population and a fixed region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction techniques are powerful tools for analyzing and planning management strategies. Many research studies based on compartmental/epidemic models have been conducted to evaluate the COVID-19 outbreak [20, 14]. Researchers have also enhanced epidemiological models by introducing new compartments and applying various machine learning techniques for better prediction accuracy [5, 3, 22]. Shinde et al. [31] summarized various forecasting techniques for COVID-19 that include stochastic theory, mathematical models, data science, and machine learning techniques. Modeling the data of COVID-19 using various statistical, prediction, and machine learning techniques can help to plan strategies to fight against a pandemic like COVID-19. A single prediction technique may not perform well in all scenarios. So, we need to develop a hybrid model to take advantage of various techniques. A hybrid model consists of multiple models or algorithms whose predictions are fused to obtain better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many mutants and variants of the SARS-Cov-2 have been reported from different countries due to which multiple waves of the COVID-19 spread was experienced by most of the countries in the world. There are multiple factors like environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind), mobility, lockdown, government policies, social distancing, isolation, health, age, gender, incubation period, awareness, fear, wearing of masks, hygiene, medical facilities, sanitization, testing, and vaccination which affect the spread pattern of the COVID-19. The related data can be used to find the root cause of the spread of the virus but accurate data collection is a big challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we develop a hybrid model incorporating SIRD epidemic model, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and stacked Long Short-Term Memory (stacked-LSTM) neural network for COVID-19 pandemic modeling and forecasting. We estimate the SIRD model parameters weekly to accommodate the recent changes in the time series of the COVID-19 spread. The periodic estimation of the parameters is able to cater to the emergence of new waves due to new variants, or changes in the government policies. We optimize the model parameters using particle swarm optimization evolutionary algorithm. Fitting of the model parameters can be performed on available data only. So, stacked-LSTM neural network is used to identify model parameters for future prediction. Stacked-LSTM is trained on the optimized parameters of SIRD, and parameter forecasting for four weeks is performed. Further, the forecasted model parameters are fed into the SIRD model to get the forecasted values of the time series data. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are listed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incorporating time-varying model parameters by estimating the parameters periodically (weekly).\n",
    "2. Incorporating the impact of all the aspects by fitting on the actual values without collecting/inducing multi-factor data.\n",
    "3. Optimization using PSO to find out optimum values of the SIRD model parameters.\n",
    "4. Use of deep learning technique (LSTM) to forecast values of the model parameters.\n",
    "5. COVID-19 pandemic modeling using optimized SIRD model parameters for improved forecasting.\n",
    "We have adopted time series data of COVID-19 cases from the highly affected three countries namely the USA, India, and the UK. We have taken the most recent COVID-19 data containing the latest two waves from each country. We compare the proposed model with two existing methods:- standard stacked-LSTM, and hybrid of SIRD and PSO. The proposed model outperformed the two compared models on all the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organization of the remaining paper is as follows. Related work is presented in section II. Materials and proposed model are presented in section III. Results and discussion are presented in section IV. Conclusions and future directions are presented in section V.\n",
    "\n",
    "II Related Work\n",
    "A number of studies based on compartmental models have been explored by the researchers to model the spread trend of the COVID-19 [32, 24, 30]. The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) [16] model has been extended by a number of researchers by introducing a few new compartments related to the COVID-19 spread. Neves and Guerrero [23] have investigated the SIR model considering either asymptomatic or few symptomatic cases of COVID-19. The authors have predicted death cases after estimating the model parameters on available data of Lombardy, Italy and Sao Paulo state in Brazil. Similarly, Postnikov [26] has investigated the effectiveness of the simple SIR model for COVID-19 prediction. He has evaluated and concluded that the SIR model can provide realistic predictions of the country-level spread of COVID-19. Bastos and Cajueiro [2] have modeled the COVID-19 spread using two variations of the SIR model. They have included social distancing parameter in the epidemic model. Forecasting results have shown that social distancing policy is able to flatten the graph of infection cases of the COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many extensions of SIRD epidemic model have been proposed to model the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the epidemic models assume that relevant model parameters, e.g., the infection rate and the recovery rate are time-invariant, and several approaches have been proposed in the literature for tuning or estimating them [29, 10]. Fanelli and Piazza [6] have analysed the COVID-19 spread dynamics in China, France, and Italy between 22 Jan, 2020 to 15 March, 2020. A simple SIRD model was used to describe the recovery rate and death rate. The model had placed the peak in Italy around March 21, 2020. A time-dependent SIRD model was proposed in [8] for provincial level COVID-19 spread prediction in Italy. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have potential to fight against a pandemic. AI forecasting techniques can be applied for predicting the number of cases and mortality rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many prediction techniques have been proposed considering various factors to improve the accuracy and matching with real scenarios [17, 18]. Zheng et al. [35] have proposed a hybrid susceptible, infected model by embedding LSTM neural network and a natural language processing module for COVID-19 prediction. The authors claimed that the proposed model can significantly reduce the prediction errors as compared to the traditional epidemic models. Researchers have investigated many machine learning and deep learning models to train prediction algorithms on COVID-19 data [1, 33, 36, 21]. The research studies are able to provide effective directions to control and manage the spread of a pandemic like COVID-19.\n",
